		<div class="lorem">Typical jungle woody plants are Sal (Shorea robusta), sissoo (Dalbergia sissoo), acacia, sterculia, tree trunks are intertwined with lianas, the most common tree rattan palm of the genus Calamus and several other species of climbing palms. The herbaceous plants are dominated by tall grasses-wild sugar cane (Saccharum spontaneum), elephant reeds (Typha elephantina), erianthus, bamboo, etc.</div>

		<div class="lorey">The Russian word "jungle" comes from the English jungle, whose roots go back to Sanskrit, where the word "jangala" (sanskr .््गल) meant "uncultivated land". The English who lived in India borrowed this word from Hindi and Urdu, in which it by this time meant "forest", and began to use it in the sense of "impenetrable thickets".</div>

			<div class="lorem-texg">&#9898; Despite the lush vegetation, the quality of the soil in the jungle leaves much to be desired. Rapid rotting caused by bacteria interferes with the accumulation of the humus layer. The concentration of iron and aluminum oxides due to soil laterization (the process of reducing the content of silica in the soil with a simultaneous increase in iron and aluminum oxides) turns the soil bright red and sometimes forms mineral deposits (for example, bauxite). On young formations, especially of volcanic origin, the soil can be quite fertile. </div>

				It comes from other-Russian. water, further from the proto-Slavic *voda (cf. art. - Slav. Voda, Bolg. Voda, serbohorv. water, sloven. vóda, Czech. voda, slvc. voda, Polish. woda, V.-luzh., n. - luzh. woda), then from proto-Indo-European *wed -, akin to lit. vanduõ, Zhem. unduo, D.-V.-n. waʒʒar "water", goth. water, English. water, Greek. ὕδωρ, ὕδατος, arm. get "river", frig. βέδυ, etc. - Indus. udakám, uda -, udán - "water", unátti "to beat with the key", "to irrigate", ṓdman - "stream", ALB. uj "water". Also related to the Russian words bucket, otter. Within the framework of an unpopular hypothesis about the existence of a once-pranostratic language, the word can be compared with the hypothetical proto-Uralic *wete (cf., for example, fin. vesi, est. vesi, Komi va, Veng. víz), as well as with supposed praaltaic, pradravidian, etc. words, and reconstructed as *wetV for the proto-language.</div>

				 <div class="youser1">Jungles are formed on abandoned arable land, cutting areas and burning areas, that is, they are the result of human activity. First there are tall grasses and shrubs that are tied up with many vines, and later grow fast-growing trees with soft wood species.</div>
				
				
				<div class="youser2">Jungles are typical for monsoon tropical areas of South and Southeast Asia, most of them grow in India, Indochina, and the Sunda Islands. The most typical jungle, the Terai, grows in swampy areas with humid or subtropical climates along the Ganges at the foot of the Himalayas.</div>

				<div class="youser3">The Russian word "jungle" comes from the English jungle, which has its roots in Sanskrit, where the word "jangala" (sanskr .््गल) meant "uncultivated land". The English who lived in India borrowed this word from Hindi and Urdu, in which it by this time meant "forest", and began to use it in the sense of " impenetrable thickets</div>

				<div class="youser4">Jungles are typical for monsoon areas of the tropics.
The largest jungles exist in the Amazon river basin (Amazon Rain forests), in Nicaragua, in the southern part of the Yucatan Peninsula (Guatemala, Belize), in most of Central America (where they are called "Selva"), in Equatorial Africa from Cameroon to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in many areas of Southeast Asia from Myanmar to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, in the Australian state of Queensland.</div>

						<div class="youser5">Trees in the jungle have several common characteristics that are not observed in plants in less humid climates.

The base of the trunk in many species has wide, woody projections. Previously, it was assumed that these protrusions help the tree to keep its balance, but now it is believed that water with dissolved nutrients flows down these protrusions to the roots of the tree. Broad leaves are also common in trees, shrubs, and grasses in the lower tiers of the forest. Tall young trees that have not yet reached the top tier also have broader foliage, which then decreases with height. Broad leaves help plants better absorb sunlight under the edges of forest trees, and they are protected from the wind from above. The leaves of the upper tier that form the canopy are usually smaller and heavily cut to reduce wind pressure. On the lower floors, the leaves are often narrowed at the ends so that this contributes to the rapid flow of water and prevents the proliferation of microbes and moss that destroy the leaves.

The tops of trees are often very well connected with each other by means of lianas or epiphyte plants that attach themselves to them.

Other characteristics of the jungle can serve as an unusually thin (1-2 mm) tree bark, sometimes covered with sharp thorns or spines; the presence of flowers and fruits growing directly on the trunks of trees; a large variety of juicy fruits that attract birds, mammals, and even fish that feed on dispersed particles.</div>
